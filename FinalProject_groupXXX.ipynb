    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been ample amounts of research in the realm of music genre classification. This is in part because music is paramount in one’s culture and daily life. The music that one gets recommended on applications such as Spotfy/Pandora is classified using the different deep and machine learning approaches. In this manner, the greater “accuracy” for recommendations is best for the consumer because they will listen to music similar to what they already listen to <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).\n",
    "Thus, the challenge for researchers is to understand what is the best model to use in order to classify the different genres. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and algorithms such as “Logistic Regression…[and] Random forest” have been utilized to extract the information from the Mel-frequencies. What Bahuleyan did at the University of Waterloo, Canada was take the data, sound waves and project them as spectrograms. In this manner, CNN can predict the genre of music. Subsequently, within their study, they depicted that there are two manners that can drive results in one manner over another. The transfer learning setting is essentially where the pre-trained weights are altered only in the manner of the feed-forward network. Additionally, the other setting is fine tuning the weights of the training process. Apart from these two settings, they also linked with the ideas of utilizing other machine learning applications. Yet, what was concluded was that between the two manners, there is no statistically significant difference in the genre classification of music. Subsequently, what they found as some of the best models for music genre classification problems was using the CNN approach or utilizing the XGBoost classifier <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). In this manner, the XGBoost is one of the preferred algorithms of machine learning because of its greater accuracy score over others such as random forest  <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",
    "Furthermore, a similar approach has been conducted using the Free Music Archive dataset with different algorithms such as the CNN, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Contrary to what most might believe, the ANN deep learning algorithm did not have the greatest score in terms of prediction accuracy. The CNN model, as aforementioned in the study above, actually proved to have the highest accuracy score of 88.54%. However, within their conclusion, the researchers determined that the CNN model is the best approach when working with spectrogram images; yet, ANN is “the best feature based classifier” <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). \n"

First, we implemented the scikit-learn libraries and then split the aforementioned merged dataset into two separate datasets: the merged_dataset_test and merged_dataset_train. Within these two datasets we further reduced the dimensionality by creating two separate datasets which contain less null values. The dataset that we utilized for both the training and testing of the tree classification was merged_dataset_lessNans which contained a subset of features (columns) from the merged dataset. Subsequently, we then split the datasets to train and test sets to fit the tree classifier. After training, we were then able to predict the genre of the songs in the test set. Procedingly, then we calculated the accuracy score of the classifier using the predictions and test set. Furthermore, we decided to allow users to input the index for the song that they want to know the genre of in order to test the classifiers accuracy. In this manner, we were able to check songs that we knew and could easily classify its genre in order to determine the accuracy of our model. The index that the user provided was manipulated in the sense that we captured the features of the song and were able to predict its respected genre using our tree classifier. We utilized reverse mapping technique in order to print out the value of the predicted genre, where each genre has an allocated float value and its categorical description (Rap, Classical, etc.). "

    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "**OK, you've given us quite a bit of tech informaiton above, now its time to tell us what to pay attention to in all that.  Think clearly about your results, decide on one main point and 2-4 secondary points you want us to understand. Highlight HOW your results support those points.  You probably want 2-5 sentences per point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our direct results show that for every row index we feed into our model, our classification tool outputs about a 33% accuracy. However, based on each of our team members’ personal criteria for classifying music genres, we found our model to have a rough ~60-70% accuracy level. Majority of the time, when we inputted a row index for a song we were all familiar with, the tree classifier outputted the “correct” genre (number). \n",
    "- A reason for our direct results may be that about 20% of our data is for testing while 80% was used for training. We can observe this at the beginning of our team’s ‘Music Categorization’ section where we assigned the variable ‘test_size’ = 0.2. Ideally we would have liked our testing dataset to be about 30% of our entire data to ensure better accuracy.\n",
    "- In addition, this level of accuracy may have been determined by the lack of variables our team used for our datasets (loudness, danceability, speechiness, acousticness, and instrumentalness) which did not give our classification model much to learn from. Potentially, for the future, finding more datasets that match our data criteria but also have additional variables we can use as music characteristics could boost our classification tool’s accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are there any problems with the work?  For instance would more data change the nature of the problem? Would it be good to explore more hyperparams than you had time for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main limitations we faced in this project was time. With this constraint we were limited in how far we could explore to acquire necessary data for our project. For example, we needed to use the datasets created by others rather than our own, which would sometimes lead to us not having some of the variables we wanted. Using data collected by outside sources (with many independent variables that were not used by our own team) resulted in our data having many null values, which was not helpful during the data wrangling process. With time as a limiting factor we were also unable to generate more clustering visualizations, in addition to our gaussian mixture model. As we were working on our GMM we ran into multiple compilation errors that hindered our ability to perfect our model, and also prevented us from exploring other visual analyses such as PCA, K-Means, etc. Furthermore, from an outsider’s perspective, some of the songs in our merged dataset are characterized as being a part of 2 or more genre categories. However, since our merged dataset limits each song to only belonging to 1 genre, this may have caused inaccuracies in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "In developing a music classification system, our team acknowledges the importance of addressing potential ethical concerns and privacy implications that may arise. We recognize the need to prioritize ethical considerations and safeguard user privacy throughout the development phases especially with our use of a dataset that relies on user behavior information. \n",
    "Ethical Considerations:\n",
    "Bias: One of the primary ethical concerns in ML-based recommendation systems is the potential for bias in the recommendations. Our team will strive to ensure that the system does not inadvertently reinforce or perpetuate biases related to race, gender, age, or other sensitive attributes. We will implement fairness-aware algorithms and regularly assess the system's performance across diverse user groups to mitigate any biases that may arise.\n",
    "Transparency: Users should have visibility into how the classification system operates and why certain classifications are made. We will prioritize transparency by documenting the algorithmic processes, providing explanations for recommendations, and enabling users to understand and control their preferences and data usage. \n",
    "User Consent: Respecting user autonomy and privacy preferences is paramount. We will incorporate mechanisms for obtaining informed consent from users regarding data collection, processing, and usage for personalized recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy Considerations: \n",
    "Data Security: Protecting sensitive user data is of utmost importance to us. We will adopt a data minimization approach, collecting only necessary data required for our classification system in order to safeguard user data throughout its lifecycle.\n",
    "Anonymity: Wherever possible, we will anonymize or de-identify user data to protect individual privacy while still enabling effective system performance. This includes using techniques such as differential privacy to prevent the re-identification of individuals from aggregated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team recognizes that despite proactive measures, unforeseen ethical dilemmas and privacy challenges may emerge once the system is in production. To address these issues, we will establish continuous monitoring, conduct regular ethical audits using tools like Deon (https://deon.drivendata.org), and remain responsive to emerging ethical guidelines and regulatory frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reiterate your main point and in just a few sentences tell us how your results support it. Mention how this work would fit in the background/context of other work in this field if you can. Suggest directions for future work if you want to.**"
